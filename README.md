-early will give you a game that ends around about Vermilion. 
Latest objectives are "Get to Lavender Town" / "Defeat Surge".
There's a lot of "do this challenge condition until X point" cards

-midgame expectation is that you'll need to clear a Snorlax at least.
Latest objectives are "Defeat Sabrina/Blaine" / "Catch Articuno".
Idea being there's a lot of stuff you can focus and get early but still circle back for later.

might do a lategame one, probably won't though.
